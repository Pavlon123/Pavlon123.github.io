				<h3>The Journey is the Destination...</h3>
				</div>
				<p class="subtext">The calm before the storm. I've handed in my thesis and now await the state exams. What a great opportunity to learn. Yet I'm crossing the river of uncertainty and work on my first blog post. It's quite possible I'm not going to make it and all will end on this single post. But who knows, as journey is the destination.</p>
				<p class="subtext">Recently I've been struck with rather dreadful thoughts. I started to worry that my thesis won't pass the judges. So I've told myself that I should at least learn HTML5 and CSS3 properly. Of course, I came up with a conclusion that I simply cannot turn into a developer in mere two weeks, therefore having no backdoor available. Let alone that one does not simply make something amazing just out of HTML and CSS. Nonetheless, the page is here and it would be a pity to leave it behind.</p>
				<p class="subtext">Which brings me to another point: one should take courage to leave his comfort zone. Even though there is little to no chance of me working as a developer, it is a signal that things are simply possible. So it is my time to man up and start believing in myself. I'll go and get ready for the state exams. Wish me luck!</p>
